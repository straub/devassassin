{"name":"DevAssassin","tagline":"One blaster, one dart, one target.","body":"DevAssassin is an adaptation of the rules of the traditional [Assassin game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_game). It's meant to be played by developers and other technical people, but should be appropriate for anyone in a casual workplace environment.\r\n\r\nI did not originate these rules, but was inspired to take this up by a friend who described a game called Dev Assassin being run in his workplace, and this set of rules is adapted from his.\r\n\r\nThese rules are provided without warranty of any kind and any liability for use of these rules is yours alone. If you have suggestions or corrections, please open an issue [on GitHub](http://github.com/straub/devassassin) or send a Pull Request.\r\n\r\n# Rules\r\n#### Version 0.1\r\n\r\n1. Your equipment consists of:\r\n    * One Nerf blaster\r\n    * One Nerf dart\r\n2. Your equipment and target will be issued by your game host.\r\n    * Alternatively, your game host may rule that existing Nerf blasters and darts may be used.\r\n3. Your target will be the name of another player participating in the game. You should keep your target secret for as long as possible, as this will gain you the element of surprise. You may only advance in the game by eliminating your target, even if you determine the names and targets of other players. Each player will have a unique target, and one player—your assassin—will be targeting you.\r\n4. The game is played only during certain time periods, Monday through Friday. The time periods for your game will be determined by your game host.\r\n    * Suggested time periods are:\r\n        - 8:55 am - 9:05 am\r\n        - 12:55 pm - 1:05 pm\r\n        - 4:55 pm - 5:05 pm\r\n5. No areas are off limits to play. Even following your target when they go out to lunch is allowed. If your target is repeatedly missing during game periods, it's up to you to find a way to reach them. Your game host and the authors of these rules are not responsible for your actions or any consequences resulting from them. Use your common-sense.\r\n6. During each time period, you may make only one attempt to assassinate any given target. You have only one dart, and you may not re-use it for further assassination attempts against the same target during a single time period.\r\n7. If you know the identity of the player targeting you, you may also fire your dart once in self-defense. Use of the dart in this manner does not prevent you from attempting an assassination during the same time period. If you successfully hit your assassin before being hit yourself, they may not assassinate you for the rest of the current time period.\r\n8. Assassination occurs when you successfully hit your target by firing the dart from your blaster. When this happens, the victim gives up the name of their target to their assassin and the assassin inherits the victim's target. The victor may continue and immediately make an attempt against their new target, even within the current time period, and should report back to the game host when the time period is over. The victim of the assassination is out of the running for the rest of the game.\r\n    * \"Dead\" players should be kept in the loop on the progress of other players by updates from the game host.\r\n9. Don't be a sore loser. Malfunctions in your equipment are just part of the game. Just like in real-life, sometimes a gun jams. You would be wise to test your equipment before the first game period begins, to be sure it works correctly. If you have repeatable issues with your equipment, bring them up with your game host. In any case, once you're assassinated, the current game is over for you, regardless of circumstances.\r\n10. The game officially begins when the game host decides everyone is ready. Usually this will come in the form of an email after everyone has picked up their equipment and been informed of their target, and the time will not be known to the players ahead of time.\r\n    * At the game host's discretion, the time may be prearranged instead.\r\n11. Once only two players are left, the winner of the game is the player who successfully assassinates the other first. Sometimes this comes down to two darts whistling past each other in midair. The game ends once only one player remains, and that player is the ultimate victor of DevAssassin, until the next game begins...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
